        ### üìù Implementation Notes:

        Building a mini-roulette to help me pick a video game when I'm too overwhelmed to pick one myself! (this is a natural progression of things when you own 100+ games I'm afraid)

        Plan:
        - ~Streamlit UI~
        - ~An actual roulette if I can get it animated~
        - ~a special 'here's a game you've never played, how about you give it a chance?'~
        - Smart game recommendations based on recent play
        - I want to differentiate this tool from just being the 'I'm feeling lucky' game picker from SteamDB by making it slightly more analytical and personalised
        - Maybe a nice dashboard & stats page to do with your Steam account too! :)
